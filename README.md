# Fun Chat - WebSocket Chat Application

## ðŸ“œ Project Overview

Welcome to **Fun Chat**! This project involves creating a chat application where users can communicate in real-time. 
The chat is built using WebSockets, ensuring both the client and server can initiate message sending. 
The application also includes features like user authentication, message history, and real-time updates on message delivery status.

The task was designed to enhance understanding of WebSockets, asynchronous coding, and DOM manipulation while giving the freedom to implement a unique visual design.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Launch the Server

Before running the application, you need to start the WebSocket server:

- Clone the server repository to your local machine [fome here](https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/fun-chat-server.git):
- Follow the instructions in the server repository to set up and run the server.
- 
### 2. Access the Application

Once the server is up and running, you can start using the chat application in one of two ways:

- **Use the deployed version:** Simply visit the following link in your browser: [Fun Chat Application](https://mrrrchat-juliabel5.netlify.app/login). 

- **Clone the repository and run locally:**
  1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/JuliaBel5/Fun-chat.git
     cd Fun chat
     ```

  2. Install the necessary dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

  3. Launch the application:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```

You can open multiple browser tabs to create several users and chat with them in real-time.

Now youâ€™re ready to start chatting with others!

Enjoy!
